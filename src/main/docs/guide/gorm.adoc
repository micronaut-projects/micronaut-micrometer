==== Using GORM for Hibernate

[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `hibernate-gorm` feature to include GORM, a basic connection pool configuration, and a default H2 database driver in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features hibernate-gorm
----
====

For Groovy users and users familiar with the Grails framework, special support for http://gorm.grails.org[GORM for Hibernate] is available. To use GORM for Hibernate you *should not* include Micronaut's built in <<sqlSupport, SQL Support>> or the `hibernate-jpa` dependency since GORM itself takes responsibility for creating the `DataSource`, `SessionFactory` etc.

Rather, you only need to include the  `hibernate-gorm` dependency in your project, a connection pool implementation, and the desired JDBC driver. For example:

dependency:micronaut-hibernate-gorm[groupId="io.micronaut.configuration"]

You will likely want to add a connection pool implementation and potentially the `h2` database for in-memory testing:

.Configuring GORM for Hibernate
[source,groovy]
----
  // Use Tomcat connection pool
  runtime 'org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-jdbc'
  // Use H2 database driver
  runtime  'com.h2database:h2'
----

You can now use the same http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#configuration[configuration properties described in the GORM documentation]. For example:

.Configuring GORM for Hibernate
[source,yaml]
----
dataSource:
    pooled: true
    dbCreate: create-drop
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:devDb
    driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
    username: sa
    password:
hibernate:
    cache:
        queries: false
        use_second_level_cache: true
        use_query_cache: false
        region.factory_class: org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.EhCacheRegionFactory
----

The following should be noted regarding using GORM for Hibernate in Micronaut:

* Each class you wish to be a GORM entity should be annotated with the `grails.gorm.annotation.Entity` annotation.
* Each method that interacts with GORM should be annotated with GORM's `grails.gorm.transactions.Transactional` to ensure a session is present. You can also add the `@Transactional` annotation to the class.
* By default Micronaut will scan for entities relative to your `Application` class. If you wish to customize this specify additional packages via the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/context/ApplicationContextBuilder.html[ApplicationContextBuilder] when starting your application.


==== Using GORM for MongoDB

[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `mongo-gorm` feature to configure GORM for MongoDB in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features mongo-gorm
----
====

For Groovy users and users familiar with Grails, special support has been added to Micronaut for using http://gorm.grails.org/latest/mongodb/manual[GORM for MongoDB].

To add support for GORM for MongoDB, first configure the MongoDB connection as per instructions earlier in the guide, then add the following dependency to your application:

dependency:micronaut-mongo-gorm[groupId="io.micronaut.configuration"]

WARNING: For GORM for MongoDB you will need to configure the database name separately as the `grails.mongodb.datataseName` property in `application.yml`.

The following should be noted regarding using GORM for MongoDB in Micronaut:

* Each class you wish to be a GORM entity should be annotated with the `grails.gorm.annotation.Entity` annotation.
* Each method that interacts with GORM should be annotated with GORM's `grails.gorm.transactions.Transactional` to ensure a session is present. You can also add the `@Transactional` annotation to the class.
* By default Micronaut will scan for entities relative to your `Application` class. If you wish to customize this specify additional packages via the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/context/ApplicationContextBuilder.html[ApplicationContextBuilder] when starting your application.

==== Using GORM for Neo4j

[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `neo4j-gorm` feature to configure GORM for Neo4j in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features neo4j-gorm
----
====

For Groovy users and users familiar with Grails, special support has been added to Micronaut for using http://gorm.grails.org/latest/neo4j/manual[GORM for Neo4j].

To add support for GORM for Neo4j, first configure the Neo4j connection as per instructions earlier in the guide, then add the following dependency to your application:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
dependency:micronaut-neo4j-gorm[groupId="io.micronaut.configuration"]
----

The following should be noted regarding using GORM for Neo4j in Micronaut:

* Each class you wish to be a GORM entity should be annotated with the `grails.gorm.annotation.Entity` annotation.
* Each method that interacts with GORM should be annotated with GORM's `grails.gorm.transactions.Transactional` to ensure a session is present. You can also add the `@Transactional` annotation to the class.
* By default Micronaut will scan for entities relative to your `Application` class. If you wish to customize this specify additional packages via the api:context.ApplicationContextBuilder[] when starting your application.
