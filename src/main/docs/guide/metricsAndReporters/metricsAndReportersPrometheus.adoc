You can include the Prometheus reporter via `io.micronaut.micrometer:micronaut-micrometer-registry-prometheus`

dependency:micronaut-micrometer-registry-prometheus[groupId="io.micronaut.micrometer"]

You can configure this reporter using `micronaut.metrics.export.prometheus`. The most commonly changed configuration properties are listed below, but see https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/blob/main/implementations/micrometer-registry-prometheus/src/main/java/io/micrometer/prometheus/PrometheusConfig.java[PrometheusConfig] for more options.

|=======
|*Name* |*Description*
|enabled |Whether to enable the reporter, for example per-environment or for local development. Default: `true`
|step |How frequently to report metrics. Default: `PT1M` (1 min). See `java.time.Duration#parse(CharSequence)`
|descriptions | Whether meter descriptions should be sent to Prometheus. Disable to minimize the amount of data sent on each scrape. Default: `true`
|=======

*IMPORTANT NOTE*: Once configured, the Prometheus-compatible metrics can be accessed from the path `/prometheus`. By default, Prometheus looks for `/metrics`, but that path serves the core Micronaut metrics, hence the need to point to `/prometheus`.

=== Prometheus Default Metrics

By default, there is a set of metrics that are exposed by the different binders. If you include the Prometheus reporter, those metrics will be available in Prometheus format as well.

Here you will find the definition of all default metrics exposed by a binder.

===== Web Metrics

.Metrics provided
|=======
|*Name* |*Description*
|http_client_requests_seconds_count|Total number of requests per second your application made to an endpoint via HTTP Client interface
|http_client_requests_seconds_sum|Sum of the duration of every request your application made to an endpoint via HTTP Client interface
|http_client_requests_seconds_max|Maximum request duration during a time window. The value resets to 0 when a new time window starts. The default time window is two minutes.
|http_server_requests_seconds_count|Total number of requests your application received at an endpoint
|http_server_requests_seconds_sum|Sum of the duration of every request your application received at an endpoint
|http_server_requests_seconds_max|Maximum request duration during a time window. The value resets to 0 when a new time window starts. The default time window is two minutes
