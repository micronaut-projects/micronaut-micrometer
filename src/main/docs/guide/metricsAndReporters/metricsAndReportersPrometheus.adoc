You can include the Prometheus reporter via `io.micronaut.configuration:micronaut-micrometer-registry-prometheus`

dependency:micronaut-micrometer-registry-prometheus[groupId="io.micronaut.micrometer"]

You can configure this reporter using `micronaut.metrics.export.prometheus`.  The most commonly changed configuration properties are listed below, but see https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/blob/master/implementations/micrometer-registry-prometheus/src/main/java/io/micrometer/prometheus/PrometheusConfig.java[PrometheusConfig] for more options

|=======
|*Name* |*Description*
|enabled |Whether to enable the reporter. Could disable to local dev for example. Default: `true`
|step |How frequently to report metrics. Default: `PT1M` (1 min).  See `java.time.Duration#parse(CharSequence)`
|descriptions | Boolean if meter descriptions should be sent to Prometheus. Turn this off to minimize the amount of data sent on each scrape. Default: `true`
|=======

*IMPORTANT NOTE*: Once set up, the Prometheus-compatible metrics can be scraped from the path `/prometheus`. Note: by default Prometheus looks for `/metrics`, but that path serves the core Micronaut metrics, hence the need to point to `/prometheus`.

=== Prometheus Default Metrics

By default, there is a set of metrics that are exposed by the different binders. If you include the Prometheus reporter, those metrics will be available in Prometheus format as well.

Here you will find the definition of all default metrics exposed by a binder.

===== Web Metrics
.Metrics provided
|=======
|*Name* |*Description*
|http_client_requests_seconds_count|Is the total number of requests per second your application made to an endpoint via HTTP Client interface
|http_client_requests_seconds_sum|Is the sum of the duration of every request your application made to an endpoint via HTTP Client interface
|http_client_requests_seconds_max|Is the maximum request duration during a time window. The value resets to 0 when a new time window starts. The default time window is 2 minutes.
|http_server_requests_seconds_count|Is the total number of requests your application received at an endpoint
|http_server_requests_seconds_sum|Is the sum of the the duration of every request your application received at an endpoint
|http_server_requests_seconds_max|Is the maximum request duration during a time window. The value resets to 0 when a new time window starts. The default time window is 2 minutes
